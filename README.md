# A Graph Algorithm Visualizer
## _W.I.P. pygame simulation app for graph algorithms_

My attempt at a graph algorithm visualizer in pygame. To be extended in the future.

## Current Features

- Grid visualization of Dijkstra's Algorithm using Euclidean distance.
- Ability to add walls to grid for the algorithm to navigate past to get to destination.

## Running the program
Please ensure that you are on the "SimplifiedVersion" branch; run the main method in "main.py".

## Credit/References
The "main" branch has code based on an MVC structure for pygame as outlined by [wesleywerner](https://github.com/wesleywerner) on Github. All credit goes to [wesleywerner](https://github.com/wesleywerner) for his work on an MVC design pattern implementation for pygame.

Please refer to this repository to see his work: [mvc-game-design](https://github.com/wesleywerner/mvc-game-design).
